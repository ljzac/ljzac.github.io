[Drone.io](https://drone.io) is now live and ready for business! It is a hosted continuous integration service.

Try it out here: [https://drone.io](https://drone.io)

It's *free* to start, no credit card required. Within minutes you can add your existing projects and have them automatically building & testing. Most programming languages and data services are supported, and new features are added constantly.

Please [contact](http://docs.drone.io/contact.html) us with any questions or suggestions, we'd love to hear from you.

Thanks,<br/>
