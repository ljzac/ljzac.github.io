We'd like to announce **Team** accounts in [drone.io](https://drone.io).

Some benefits of team accounts include:

* Projects are created under your Team / Business name
* Team Members are able to create and manage projects (*not just the account owner*)
* Teams have separate billing information (*use your company credit card*)
* Teams have separate quotas
* Teams can execute more than 1 build at a time


### Creating a Team Account

It's easy to create a team account. Sign in and navigate to **account > teams**,
and click the **Create Team** button. You'll be prompted to choose a team name
and enter your billing information.

Drone.io uses Gravatar for your team's logo. If you want your company logo
displayed, then you'll need to add your team account's email address to Gravatar
along with an image.

Once a Team Account is created you can add Team Members:

### Creating Team Projects

When creating a new Project you will be prompted to choose the Team account
under which the Project should be created.

![Select Project Owner](/img/screenshot_settings-members.png)

Your project name will reflect its owner. For example, when I create a project
using my individual account it is named `bradrydzewski/myproject`, however
projects created under our Drone team account are named `drone/myproject`.


### Pricing

With team support, Drone.io is perfect for your startup or small business. Our
new plans are competitively priced, and **FREE** for open source projects.
