### Aqui empieza el post
Just three weeks ago we launched [drone.io](https://drone.io), a hosted

Many users requested support for more languages. Today we're excited to

When creating a new Project you will see options for PHP and Scala languages:

### Scala Builds

Scala versions 2.8.2 and 2.9.2 are both supported. For dependency management
and unit testing we've included **SBT** and **Maven**.

You can read more about our Scala builds [here](http://docs.drone.io/scala.html).
