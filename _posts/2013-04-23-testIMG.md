# How does it work?

Real time output should work with any browser that supports websockets.  Basic support for xterm control characters and colors was also added.

Now when you view a build's details you'll see the output updated in real time.  This works for any build you kickoff manually or for builds requested automatically by your repo using Drone.io's service hook.
