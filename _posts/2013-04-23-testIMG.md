# How does it work?

<!--  figure-slider -->                  
<div class="figure-slider">
	<div class="slider flexslider">
	<ul class="slides">
		<li>
	  		![Una puerta](http://i.imgur.com/ocb6MMdm.jpg)
	  	</li>
	 </ul>
	</div> 
<span>Real time output should work with any browser that supports websockets.  Basic support for xterm control characters and colors was also added.</span>
</div>

Now when you view a build's details you'll see the output updated in real time.  This works for any build you kickoff manually or for builds requested automatically by your repo using Drone.io's service hook.
